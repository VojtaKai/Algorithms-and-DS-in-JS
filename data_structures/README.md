# Data structures
Different programming languages have different data strctures. Here we focus on javascript.

## What is a data structure?
A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently

A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data

## Why learn data structures?
To efficiently manage (any) data, you need data structures. -> Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way

Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of the books and they are stored randomly.

The difference between a function taking a few miliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selecion of the right data strcture

DS are time and memory efficient ways to access / store data.

Deeper understanding of already known concepts, e.g. DOM - tree data structure, Browser back and forward buttons - stack data structure, OS job scheduling - queue data structure


## Discussed data structures
### Built-in
- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

[More about built-in DS](./build-in/README.md)

### Custom (use the built-in DS)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular queues
- Linked lists
- Hash tables
- Trees
- Graphs
