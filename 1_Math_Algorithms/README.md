## Recursion
#### What?
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

Recursion is when a function calls itself

#### Why?
A great technique to simplify your solution

If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful

#### Things to know
Base case - A condition to termine the recursion. Every recursive solution needs to have it.

Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.

#### Tips
Figure out how to break down the problem into smaller versions of the same problem (the return statement for which we further call the function recursively)

Identify the base case for recusrion (conditions which will return, recursion stops)
